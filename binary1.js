Things That Make Me Go Hmmm

Write a function that will take any integer from 0 to 255 and translate it to a binary number. 

The input should be an integer between 1 and 255

The output should be a number 8-digits long comprised of 0's and 1's, representing the given number in binary form.

0 = 00000000 
1 = 00000001
2 = 00000010
4 = 00000100
8 = 00001000
16 = 00010000
32 = 00100000
64 = 01000000
128 = 10000000
255 = 11111111

Power of 2

8


Example input:
number = 83; // 64 + 16 + 2 + 1

output = 01010011; 

// Better without the leading zero:

output = 1010011;
